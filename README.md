#Project analis data

### Brief Description

The "Prediction of Bike Rental Count Hourly or Daily Based on Environmental and Seasonal Settings" project aims to analyze and forecast bike rental patterns by leveraging various environmental factors and seasonal characteristics. By utilizing historical rental data, this study investigates the influence of temperature, humidity, weather conditions, day of the week, and seasonal changes on bike rental counts.

Through data analysis and predictive modeling, the project seeks to identify trends and patterns in bike rentals across different times of the day and seasons. This information can be invaluable for bike-sharing companies, urban planners, and policymakers to optimize bike availability, enhance user experience, and promote sustainable transportation solutions. 

The key objectives of this project include:

- Understanding how environmental conditions, such as temperature and humidity, impact bike rental behavior.
- Analyzing seasonal variations in bike rentals to identify peak usage periods.
- Developing predictive models to forecast bike rentals based on environmental and seasonal data, facilitating better resource allocation and planning.

Overall, this project contributes to a deeper understanding of bike rental dynamics, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions that support sustainable urban mobility.

## Features
- **Data Wrangling**: Clean and preprocess the dataset to ensure data quality and prepare it for analysis and modeling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze the dataset to discover patterns, trends, and relationships in bike rentals
- **Data Visualization**: Interactive visualizations to analyze trends in bike rentals, including hourly usage, seasonal patterns, and the impact of weather conditions.
- **User-Friendly Dashboard**: A Streamlit dashboard that allows users to filter data by hour, season, weather situation, and more, providing insights into bike rental behavior.
